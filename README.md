Website Project


## Technologies Used
As per the project instructions, I used HTML, CSS and JQuery. W3 schools was of great assistance in figuring out a few problems.

I used VS Code to write this website.

## My Approach
I tried to approach this is roughly 4-5 steps:
    
1. Create all HTML elements, filling some in.
For some pages, I actually put in actual data (resume page) because i went out of scope, and I took the opprtunity to get good resue HTML set up for future use. For amny others, I used Lorem Ipsum to fill out my HTML sections and get a better sense of how the website looked filled out. 
    
2. Get basic CSS up -  borders for each element, basic colors, etc.
I put borders around each HTML element so it's easier to visualize changes as they happen. I also set up some basics like flexbox, picked some basic colors, and tried to generally get elements where I wanted them.
 
3. Spend some time on the page look and feel, and created my media queries.
This is when I start to make changes to buttons, configure my header and footer properly, and think about where I can make some hay with Javascript.
  
4. Get jQuery/javascript components running.
From here, I started working iwth JQuery to get my interactive elements up. I definitely made changes to my plans while working on this part, as I felt some elements became unfeasible to implement in the time I alloted.

5. Complete content population
I added more text to certain sections for a fuller page.

6. Make finishing touches
Cleaned up some CSS mistakes. Tried to organize the CSS into sections that made sense.

## Installation Instructions
There are no installation instructions.

## Unsolved Problems
1. When shrinking the page, the main and sidebar sections don't fit nicely under any picture I may have on the sidebar.
2. Spacing feels pretty wonky.
3. My rickroll function kind of gaslights people -  it still pushes the user into the video if someone clicks it
4. The list elements on my home page stick out a bit to the right
5. My header and footer are set to 100% length, but somehow my footer sticks out a little
6. I kept breaking the margins/padding for my sidebar images, so it's not as spaced as I would like.
7. CSS is a mess and redundant-  hard to find what I need in good time.
